This code plots the Spherical Equivalent Diameter (SED) of crystals (mainly feldspar/quartz) identified in Bishop Tuff pumice. 
The code plots several things: 
(1) A basic histogram 
(2) A log-scale histogram 
(3) A cumulative distribution function (CDF) 
(4) A population density histogram 
(5) A population density histogram that is log-scale 
(6) Two population density histograms of two different data-sets overlayed
